Research interests \\

\bigskip

My primary research interests include functional programming
languages, combinatorics, embedded domain-specific languages, and type
systems.  More broadly, running through all of my research are three
major themes which shape and direct my efforts:

\begin{itemize}
\item Architecting.
\item Beauty.
\item Communication.
\end{itemize}

In what follows, I describe several current areas of research,
highlighting the above themes, and elaborate on future directions of
research.

\section*{Combinatorics}
\label{sec:combinatorics}

I am keenly interested in the intersection of combinatorics and
computation, particularly in taking purely combinatorial results and
enriching them with a computational interpretation.  My dissertation
research focuses on the \emph{theory of species}, which XXX as a
unifying framework for enumerative combinatorics.  As a purely
combinatorial theory, species are relatively well-explored; but XXX.
The core of my dissertation is to port the theory of species from set
theory to constructive type theory, and use species as a basis for
data structures in programming languages, resulting in a theory of
\emph{labelled structures} which unifies algebraic data types (lists,
binary trees, \dots) and what one would more typically think of as
labelled structures (arrays, finite maps, \dots).  The theory of
species can also serve as a foundation for understanding structures
with \emph{symmetry} (cycles, bags, \dots)

Generating functions. XXX This is a rich seam of material with plenty
of combinatorics left to ``mine'' for computational significance.
